It is hard to belive we are now rapidly approaching the fall season and Halloween is right around the corner. The preparations for the Halloween show have begun. At least one new song has been added so far and some of the older ones have been updated.

The show will run from 6:30pm until 10pm everyday. We are hoping to be up and running the first week in October. Please be courteous to the neighbors and try not to block driveways.

The radio station frequency will be changing this year 89.5 FM due to another regional radio station occupying the one we have used for years. If your radio supports RDS, the playing song info should be displayed.

You can request your favorite song to be played when visiting the Compound. The url is the same as last year, so if you have it bookmarked you should be good to go. The page will show you the currently playing song as well as the next one comming up. All the songs are listed so you can see the entire list. Clicking on a song will add it to the list to be played.
