After many weeks of preparations and work to setup the show, it is ready to go live. The first performances will be on 10-3-2024. We have several new features this year. In addition to the Pumpkin and his ghouls, Frank has joined to Ghost to lead and accompany on many songs. More lights have been added the house on the end of the road this year. The house leading into the road has expanded the lights there as well.

The show runs from 6:30pm until 10pm everyday. Please be courteous to the neighbors and don't block driveways.

The radio station is the same as it has been for many years. 93.3 FM. IF your radio supports RDS, the playing song info should be displayed.

You can request your favorite song to be played when visiting the Compound. The url has changed from last year, so if you have it bookmarked you will need to update it. The page will show you the currently playing song as well as the next one comming up. All the songs are listed so you can see the entire list. Clicking on a song will add it to the list to be played.
